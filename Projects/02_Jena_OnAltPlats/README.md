# Jena, on Alternative Platforms
We can do Microservices, sure. Negating the need for alternative platforms.
However, there is technical risk in some sense when a technology is locked in. 
Locked to a single language, a single platform, or in the case of Semantic Technologies, 
more often then not, to a single framework. There are other frameworks, yes. Pop 
the hood and take a look around. Nothing is put together quite like Jena, 
nothing in the semantic spectrum has is depth of features, its level of 
optimizition and performance. It is fine to do Microservices but, when 
that is the only option, it is true that, we must make an entry in the 
liability columns of our tech-org balance sheets. This is a low-pri project 
to demonstrate the liberation of Jena onto other platforms. Perhaps such as 
iOS in Swift. Maybe onto .NET C#. One Language, One Platform, and most worse, 
one library, sux. We can do better, this(software) is liquid flow dynamics. 

Lets make it behave as such.
